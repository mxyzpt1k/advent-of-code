# Advent of Code 2024

## Monday, December 16

Back to scheme again.

## Sunday, December 15

Created an animation of the part 2 problem.

## Saturday, December 14

After yesterday, I expected another scaling problem and went with a
math-y solution for part 1.  That took longer than I care to admit to
get right, and then I had to write code to step through each iteration
anyway for part 2.

## Friday, December 13

Solved part 1 in Perl, but Math::BigRat gave me issues in part 2.
The same code (basically) in SBCL (common lisp) worked right off.
There's still a little Perl to convert the input to something easy
for SBCL to read.

Sovled part 1 with a brute force approach, but part 2 required
a litte more thought. I ended up combining duplicate keys
and tracking counts along with the numbers.

## Tuesday, December 10

Another night of Scheme. I switched from Chez to Scheme48 because
while Chez is very fast, I'm not as familiar with it.

Oddly enough, a bug in my part one code turned out to be the solution
for part two. I noticed when the ratings described for the larger
example in part two matched some of debuging output.

## Monday, December 9

I struggled to get a Scheme version to work in part one, then went to
bed tired and a little frustrated after a couple false starts for part
two.  In the morning, I turned to Ruby instead, and banged out a solution
fairly quickly.
