# Advent of Code 2024

## Monday, December 9

I struggled to get a Scheme version to work in part one, then went to
bed tired and a little frustrated after a couple false starts for part
two.  In the morning, I turned to Ruby instead, and banged out a solution
fairly quickly.

Another night of Scheme. I switched from Chez to Scheme48 because
while Chez is very fast, I have a hard time getting good info from the
debugger.

Oddly enough, a bug in my part one code turned out to be the solution
for part two. I noticed when the ratings described for the larger
example in part two matched some of debuging output.
